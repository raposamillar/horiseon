# Code Refactoring for Horiseon

## Aim
The client, Horiseon, has asked for an updated webpage that will meet modern accessibility standards.

## Actions Taken
Semantic HTML tags and alt descriptions were added to allow screenreaders to process content logically.  The generic title in the header was replaced with the company name.

CSS selectors were reorganized accordingly and consolidated.

Comments were added to indicate the changes made and assist future developers.

## Result
The refactored webpage displays a clearer structuring of elements, classes, id's, and selectors.  It meets HTML5 standards and will be easier for the company to maintain going forward.
